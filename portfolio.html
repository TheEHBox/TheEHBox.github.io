                <span>CSSE 220, known as Object-Oriented Software Development, had a final project where teams would create a game that was similar to Jetpack Joyride.</span>
                <span>It needed to react to the player pressing keys on the keyboard, and have the player stay within the bounds of the screen.</span>
                <span>The player character also needed to collide with and not go through barriers.</span>
                <span>There were missiles (sometimes homing) to avoid and coins to collect.</span>
                <span>My team decided to implement extra features, like sidescrolling, and resizing to fit the current window.</span>
            </li>

                <h2>CSSE 230: Editor Trees</h2> <!-- Again, no where to link to. -->

                <p></p> <!-- create a new line-->
                <span>CSSE 230, known as Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis, had a (non-final) project where teams would implement a version of an AVL tree.</span>
                <span>When needed, the tree would rotate, which involves rearranging the structure of the tree to make it more efficient for traversing.</span>
                <span>The difference from a regular AVL tree is that it doesn't have the search property.</span>
                <span>It instead uses index to access items, which were characters.</span>
                <span>It is called "Editor" because it could be used as the backend of a word editor.</span>

                <span>In high school, in my free time, I worked on making a series of maze games.</span>
                <span>They gradually got more and more elaborate.</span>
                <span>Some are two player.</span>
                <span>Some have enemies to avoid.</span>
                <span>Some are 3D.</span>
